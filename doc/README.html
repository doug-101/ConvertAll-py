<h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>

<p>Why write another unit converter?  There are plenty of them out
there.  Well, I couldn't find one that worked quite the way I
wanted.</p>

<p>With ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want.  If
you want to convert from inches per decade, that's fine.  Or from
meter-pounds.  Or from cubic nautical miles.  The units don't have to
make sense to anyone else.</p>

<p>Since I'm not in the software business, I'm making this program
free for anyone to use, distribute and modify, as long as it is not
incorporated into any proprietary programs.  If you like the software,
feel free to let others know about it.  And let me know what you think
- my email address is doug101 AT bellz DOT org</p>

<h2><a name="features"></a>Features</h2>

<ul>

  <li>The base units for conversion may be either typed (with
  auto-completion) or selected from a list.</li>

  <li>As a unit is typed, the unit list is automatically filtered to
  show only units with matching words.</li>

  <li>In general, either a unit's full name or its abbreviation can be
  used.</li>

  <li>Units may be combined with the "*" and "/" operators.</li>

  <li>Units may be raised to powers (squared, cubed, etc.) with the "^"
  operator.</li>

  <li>Units in the denominator may be grouped with parenthesis.</li>

  <li>Units with non-linear scales, such as temperature, can also be
  converted.</li>

  <li>Recently used unit combinations may be picked from a menu.</li>

  <li>Numbers may be entered on either the "From" or the "To" units
  side, for conversions in both directions.</li>

  <li>Basic mathematical expressions may be entered in place of
  numbers.</li>

  <li>Options control the formatting of numerical results.</li>

  <li>The unit data includes over 500 units.</li>

  <li>Conversions between various number bases (decimal, hexadecimal,
  octal and binary) can be done in a separate dialog window.</li>

  <li>A decimal number can be converted to fractional numbers in a
  separate dialog window.</li>

  <li>The format of the unit data file makes it easy to add additional
  units.</li>

  <li>Command line options are available to do conversions without the
  GUI.</li>

  <li>The user interface and the unit data are available in Catalan,
  English, French, German, Russian, Spanish and Swedish.</li>

your option) any later version.</p>

<p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY.  See the <tt>LICENSE</tt> file provided with
this program for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="sysreq"></a>System Requirements</h2>

<h3><a name="linux-sys"></a>Linux</h3>

<p>ConvertAll requires the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li>Python (Version 3.4 or higher)</li>
  <li>Qt (Version 5.4 or higher - see <a
    href="http://qt-project.org">Qt Project</a> for more
  information)</li>
  <li>PyQt (Version 5.4 or higher - see <a
    href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk">Riverbank</a>
    for more information)</li>
</ul></p>

<h3><a name="win-sys"></a>Windows</h3>

<p>Using the files provided in the binary distribution, ConvertAll
should run on any computer running Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 or 10.</p>

<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation</h2>

<h3><a name="linux-inst"></a>Linux</h3>

<p>Extract the source files from the convertall tar file, then change to
the <tt>ConvertAll</tt> directory in a terminal.  For a basic
installation, simply execute the following command as root:  <tt>python
  install.py</tt></p>

<p>If your distribution defaults to Python 2.x, you may need to
substitute <tt>python3</tt> for <tt>python</tt> in these commands.</p>

<p>To see all install options, use: <tt>python install.py -h</tt>.  To
install ConvertAll with a different prefix (the default is
<tt>/usr/local</tt>), use:  <tt>python install.py -p
  /prefix/path</tt></p>

<h3><a name="win-inst"></a>Windows</h3>

<p>To install for all users, execute the
<tt>ConvertAll-x.x.x-install-all.exe</tt> file.  Administrator
permissions are required.</p>

<p>To install for a single user (administrator rights are not required),
execute the <tt>ConvertAll-x.x.x-install-user.exe</tt> file.</p>

<p>For a portable install, execute the
<tt>ConvertAll-x.x.x-install-user.exe</tt> file, uncheck the shortcuts
and uninstaller tasks, and check the portable config task.</p>

<h2><a name="using"></a>Using ConvertAll</h2>

<h3><a name="basics"></a>Basics</h3>

<p>Simply type a unit name in the "From Unit" edit window.  As you type,
the list below the window will be filtered to show only matching units.
Matching unit names contain words starting with the words that are
typed.  Either type the complete unit name/abbreviation or hit the
return key to use the unit highlighted (blue letters) in the list.  Of
course, clicking with the mouse on a unit in the list will also add the
unit to the edit window.  You may also use the up and down arrow keys to
highlight nearby units from the list.</p>

<p>Repeat the unit selection in the "To Unit" edit window.  When done,
if the units are compatible, the numeric edit windows below the unit
lists will activate.  A number may be entered into either numeric window
and the other window will display the conversion result.</p>

<h3><a name="combine"></a>Combining Units</h3>

<p>The real strength of ConvertAll lies in its ability to combine
multiple units.  Simply type the unit names with an '*' or a '/' between
them.  This allows the entry of units such as "ft * lbf" or "mi / hr".
The '^' symbol may be used for exponents, such as "ft^3" or "ft * lbm /
sec^2".  Negative exponents are allowed for units such as "sec^-1" (per
second), but may switch the multiplication or division symbol ("ft *
sec^-2" becomes "ft / sec^2").</p>

<p>Multiplication and division have the same precedence, so they are
evaluated left-to-right.  Parenthesis may also be used to group units in
the denominator.  So "m / sec / kg" can also be entered as "m / (sec *
kg)".  The version with parenthesis is probably less confusing.</p>

<p>The buttons below the unit text boxes can also be used to add operators to
the active unit that is closest to the cursor.  The Square and Cube buttons
will add or replace exponents.  The Multiply and Divide buttons will add "*"
and "/" operators.</p>

<p>Similarly, clicking on a unit from the list generally replaces the
unit nearest the cursor.</p>

<p>The "Clear Unit" button below the operator buttons may be used to
empty the unit edit window to allow a new unit to be entered.</p>

<p>The "Filter List" button can be used to show only one type of unit in
the list.  Note that this doesn't show units that could be combined to
form a type.</p>

<h3><a name="nonlinear"></a>Non-Linear Conversions</h3>

<p>The conversion of some units is non-linear.  Examples of these
include the Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature scales (due to an
offset zero point) and the American Wire Gauge (logarithmic).  The
non-linear units are labeled as such in the comments column.</p>

<p>These units can be converted only when they are not combined with
other units or used with an exponential operator.  Otherwise the
conversion would not be meaningful.</p>

<h3><a name="shortcut"></a>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>When typing unit names, spaces are ignored, so they may be skipped.
It is also generally ignored if a plural form of the unit name is typed.
For squared and cubed units (positive exponents of 2 or 3) the "^"
symbol does not need to be typed.</p>

<p>When a partially typed unit is highlighted in the list (blue
lettering), hitting enter will complete the name.  The up an down arrow
keys can be used to highlight nearby units in the list prior to hitting
enter.  The unit closet to the cursor will be replaced.</p>

<p>The "Recent Unit" button opens a menu of recently used units and
unit combinations.  The current unit combination is replaced with any
selections from this menu.</p>

<p>The tab key can be used to cycle between the "From" and "To" unit test
boxes and the "From" and "To" number editors.</p>

<p>The number to be converted may be entered in either the "From" or
"To" unit side.  Standard or scientific notation may be used, or an
expression including the normal math operators (+, -, *, /, **) and
parenthesis may be entered.</p>

<h3><a name="numbering"></a>Numbering System Conversions</h3>

<p>The "Bases"  button brings up a dialog that can convert between
various numbering system bases.  There are entry boxes for decimal,
hexadecimal, octal and binary entries.  A number can be entered into any
of the boxes and equivalents will be shown in the others.</p>

<p>The "Fractions" button brings up a dialog that can list fractional
equivalents for a decimal number.  Type the number and press enter.  The
fractions are listed in order of increasing accuracy.</p>

<h3><a name="options"></a>Options</h3>

<p>The "Options..." button allows for changing several default
settings.  These settings are automatically stored so that ConvertAll
will re-start with the settings last used.</p>

<p>The first options control the display of numerical results,
including the use of scientific notation and the number of decimal
places.  Be cautious about setting the number of decimal places to a
low value, which can result in a significant loss of accuracy.  Six
places or higher is recommended (eight is the default).</p>

<p>There is an option to set the number of recent units to be saved.
Setting it to zero will disable the Recent Unit buttons.  Another option
will automatically load the most recent previous units at startup.</p>

<p>There are options to hide the operator text buttons (first row), and
the unit buttons (second row).  These can be hidden to save space
if the keyboard will be used to enter the operators.</p>

<p>Buttons are also included on the options dialog to control GUI colors
and fonts.  Colors can be selected by theme or individually.  Larger
fonts can be selected for use on high-resolution displays.</p>

<h3><a name="cmdline"></a>Command Line Usage</h3>

<p>Conversions may be done from the command line (Linux or DOS console)
without invoking the graphical interface.  Enter the command
("convertall" on Linux, "convertall_dos" from the Windows binary), the
number, the from unit and the to unit (separated by spaces) to do the
conversion.  Unit names containing spaces should be surrounded by
quotes.  Or, to be prompted for each unit entry, use the "-i" option
("convertall -i" on Linux, "convertall_dos -i" from Windows).</p>

<p>After the conversion is done, ConvertAll will prompt for a new number
to do the same conversion.  Or "n" can be entered to start a new
conversion, "r" to reverse the conversion or "q" to quit.</p>

<p>For a more detailed list of options, use the "-h" option ("convertall
-h" on Linux, "convertall_dos -h" on Windows).</p>

  edited unit data file.</li>

</ul>

<h3>January 22, 2008 - Release 0.4.1</h3>

<ul><b>New Features:</b>

  <li>An optional command line mode was added to do conversions without
  the graphical interface.  Enter the command ("convertall"), the
  number, the from unit and the to unit (separated by spaces) to do the
  conversion.  For a more detailed list of options, enter "convertall
  -h" on the command line.</li>

</ul>

<ul><b>Updates:</b>

  <li>The icon used for ConvertAll has been updated.  Thanks to Ricardo
  Berlasso for the new artwork.</li>
