            <h1>What is ConvertAll?</h1>

            <p>Why write another unit converter?  There are plenty of them
            out there.  Well, I couldn't find one that worked quite the way
            I wanted.</p>

            <p>With ConvertAll, you can combine the units any way you want.
            If you want to convert from inches per decade, that's fine.  Or
            from meter-pounds.  Or from cubic nautical miles.  The units
            don't have to make sense to anyone else.</p>

            <p>In addition to this installed version, there is also an online
            version, written in JavaScript.  See <a
            href="http://convertall-js.bellz.org">convertall-js.bellz.org</a>
            to try it out.</p>

            <p>A source code repository is available at <a
            href="https://github.com/doug-101/ConvertAll">GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h2>April 12, 2011 - Translation Update 0.5.1b</h2>

              <li>Fixed inconsistencies in all three unit data translations

              unchanged.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>April 23, 2010 - Release 0.5.0</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Multiplication and division operators now have the same
              precedence.  In previous versions of ConvertAll, a series of
              units after a division symbol were assumed to be in the
              denominator.  Now, a division operator only affects the unit (or
              the unit group in parenthesis) immediately after the
              operator.</li>

              <li>Parenthesis are now supported to group units in the
              denominator of a combined unit.  For example, ""m / sec / kg"
              can also be entered as "m / (sec * kg)".</li>

              <li>"Recent Unit" buttons have been added that open a menu of
              recently used units and unit combinations.  A unit selected from
              the menu will replace the current unit combination.  There is
              also a new option dialog entry that controls the maximum length
              of this menu.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Added the tonne force metric force unit.</li>

              <li>Added hundredweight long and hundredweight short mass
              units.</li>

              <li>Added an American Wire Gauge (AWG) area unit in addition to
              the existing AWG diameter unit.</li>

              <li>Added the tonne oil equivalent and the tonne coal equivalent
              energy units.</li>

              <li>Added the ton refrigeration power unit.</li>

              <li>Added the darcy and millidarcy permeability units.</li>

              <li>French and German translations have been added for the user
              interface and the unit data.  To use them, download and install
              the "convertall-i18n..." file for your platform (in addition to
              installing the standard ConvertAll package).</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>Fixed problems with running in the command line mode from
              Linux consoles without X11 present.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>September 24, 2009 - Release 0.4.3</h2>

            <ul><b>New Features:</b>

              <li>Prepared ConvertAll for translation efforts by properly
              handling Unicode characters in unit data and by marking internal
              program strings for translation.  Volunteers for translating
              ConvertAll into other languages are welcome.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Updates:</b>

              <li>Added solar mass and pennyweight mass units.</li>

              <li>Added therm and thermie energy units.</li>

              <li>Added the US survey foot length unit.</li>

              <li>Added the mpg imp mileage unit.</li>

              point to the more modern desktop publishing point.</li>

            </ul>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>A critical QString conversion bug that caused ConvertAll to
              not run with the latest version of PyQt (4.5.4) was fixed.</li>

              <li>Command line quiet mode was fixed to avoid an interactive

              value was for 0 degrees C.</li>

              <li>Fixed a bug that could hide messages about errors in a
              manually edited unit data file.</li>

              conversions without the graphical interface.  Enter the
              command ("convertall"), the number, the from unit and the to
              unit (separated by spaces) to do the conversion.  For a more
              detailed list of options, enter "convertall -h" on the
              command line.</li>

            </ul>

              <li>Alternate units have been added for kilobyte, megabyte,
              etc., marked "IEC std".  These convert using powers of 10,
              rather than powers of 2.</li>

              <li>ConvertAll was ported to the Qt4 library. This involved
              a significant rewrite of the code.  The previous versions
              used Qt3.x on Linux and Qt2.3 on Windows.  Benefits include

              the installation directory to a location under the
              "Documents and Settings" folder.  This avoids problems on
              multi-user systems and for users with limited access
              rights.</li>

            <ul><b>Bug Fixes:</b>

              <li>The barn unit, used in particle physics, was corrected.

              area unit.</li>

            </ul>

              now saved at exit.</li>

              ^2, ^3 and Clear Unit) to be hidden.</li>
